// Everything in this scene is now a StandardPbrMaterial, whose diffuse BRDF divides albedo by π, so the
// lights take the Phong→PBR ×π exposure. This has to move together with the materials: when the knights
// became PBR while this still read 'phong', they were lit ~π× too dim, their skins crushed toward black
// and lost saturation, and the whole army took on a dull grey cast. That looks like a material or
// reflection problem and is not one — no amount of metalness or environment tuning corrects an exposure
// mismatch. If any material here is ever converted back, this has to change with it.
//
// tuning lifts the linear-space result back toward AwayJS's gamma-space look, but it has to leave the
// floor below the ACES shoulder. The shadow map only attenuates the DIRECTIONAL term, so a floor whose
// ambient-only value already tone-maps to white cannot show a cast shadow at all — lit and shadowed
// both land on the flat part of the curve. Keeping the lit floor near 1.0 pre-tone-map (and ambient
// near a third of that) is what makes the knights' shadows read, and it costs nothing elsewhere: the
// key light carries the knights' lit sides instead of a heavy ambient fill washing everything out.

// global exposure cannot serve both: set it to read the armour and the floor clips flat, taking the cast
// shadows with it. Holding the floor's albedo just below white keeps its lit squares off the ceiling so
// the knights' shadows still have somewhere to darken into.
// PBR like the knights, so one light rig serves both. Mixing kinds is what broke this: the light was
// still declared shading:'phong' — no ×π exposure — after the knights became PBR materials that divide
// albedo by π, so they were lit roughly π× too dim and the skins crushed toward black, losing their
// colour. That reads as a dull grey sheen over everything, and no amount of metalness or environment
// tuning fixes it, because the problem is exposure rather than material. Specular black and shininess 1
// on the old Blinn material meant "matte", which is roughness 1 here.

// field above it; direction and bounds never change, so the camera is configured once. The tight-fit
